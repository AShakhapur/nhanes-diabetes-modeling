# nhanes-diabetes-modeling
This project investigates the relationship between Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) — a clinical marker for diabetes — and various demographic, biometric, and socioeconomic factors using NHANES data. The aim is to identify non-linear effects, interaction terms, and disparities in diabetes risk across subpopulations.
